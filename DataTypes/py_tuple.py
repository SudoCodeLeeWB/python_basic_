# tuple data type
#tuple is covered with (), not must be covered
#tuple is <immutable>
tuple_sample1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

#however, tuple is only different with list from immutable. Therefore, indexing/slicing/calculating , len() is same.

#tuple error occurs on runtime.

#error occurs => when trying to remove element of tuple.
del tuple_sample1[2]

#error occurs => when trying to change the element of tuple.
tuple_sample1[2] = 3

#** calculating tuple/list/string array is not changing the data type value inside, it is just showing the data elements with calculated
